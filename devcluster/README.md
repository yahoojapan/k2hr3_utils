# k2hr3 installation for development

This guide provides instructions on a k2hr3 system installation for development.

## TLDR

The following commands will create your own k2hr3 system in localhost.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yahoojapan/k2hr3_utils.git && cd k2hr3_utils/devcluster
$ sh cluster.sh \
   -s http://127.0.0.1/identity \
   -t rabbit://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/
```

As you see, you must pass two arguments at least:
* An OpenStack Identity Endpoint URL  
  For example, 'http://127.0.0.1/identity' which means an identity server works in localhost.
* An OpenStack Message Broker Server URL  
  For example, 'rabbit://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/' means a RabbitMQ server works in localhost. The user 'guest' with the password 'guest' can login.  

## k2hr3 architecture overview

This chapter describes the k2hr3 system overview. k2hr3 consists of the following 5 components.

* k2hr3_app  
  provides an interactive UIs for human operators to configure their ACL roles, rules and resources.
* k2hr3_api  
  provides REST APIs which are used by k2hr3_app and k2hr3_osnl to save ACL roles, rules and resources and load them in k2hr3_dkc.
* k2hr3_dkc  
  stores ACL roles, rules, resources and other k2hr3 system data.
* OpenStack  
  [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) is a software platform for cloud  computing developed by the [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) community.
* k2hr3_osnl  
  is a plugin for [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) Notification Listener which looks at incomming messages from  [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) services and invokes the k2hr3_api delete API with parameters of a removed instance-id and its ip-addresses.

## k2hr3 components installation order

This chapter instructs the installation order of k2hr3 components.

### TLDR

We recommend the following installation order:

* 1 OpenStack or k2hr3_dkc  
* 2 k2hr3_api  
* 3 k2hr3_app or k2hr3_osnl  

### Rationale

[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) services should start before k2hr3_api starts, because k2hr3_api use [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) Service Endpoints. That means [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) should be installed before k2hr3_api. k2hr3_api reads and writes data in k2hr3_dkc. Thant means k2hr3_dkc should be installed before k2h3r_api and k2hr3_api should be installed before k2hr3_app and k2hr3_osnl. k2hr3_dkc is an independent component from [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/). k2hr3_app and k2hr3_osnl are independent of each other. Therefore you need not to think their installation orders. As a result, following installation order is recommended.

* OpenStack or k2hr3_dkc  
* k2hr3_api  
* k2hr3_app or k2hr3_osnl  

## (1) OpenStack configuration

This chapter instructs [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) configurations for k2hr3. If you have not deployed [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), see the [OpenStack Rocky Deployment Guides](https://docs.openstack.org/rocky/deploy/) and please deploy it first. [Devstack](https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/) is one of the best solution for those who will deploy [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) for development usage.

![deploy-openstack](img/k2hr3_utils_2.png)

Technically, [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/)  services emit notification messages by the [oslo.messaging](https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.messaging/latest/). The [oslo.messaging](https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.messaging/latest/) defines the messaging driver in the configuration file. For instance, [OpenStack neutron](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/) uses the **messagingv2** driver in the following configuration:
```
    [oslo_messaging_notifications]
    #
    # From oslo.messaging
    #
    # The Drivers(s) to handle sending notifications. Possible values are
    # messaging, messagingv2, routing, log, test, noop (multi valued)
    # Deprecated group/name - [DEFAULT]/notification_driver
    driver = messagingv2
```

A message driver determines the message format. Here is a sample message by [OpenStack neutron](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/) configured to use the **messagingv2** driver.
```
{
    "event_type": "port.delete.end",
    "message_id": "76c35877-9d0c-4faf-b4e5-7c51828f37a0",
    "payload": {
        ...
        "device_id": "12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678",
        "device_owner": "compute:nova",
        "extra_dhcp_opts": [],
        "fixed_ips": [
            {
                "ip_address": "172.16.0.1",
                "subnet_id": "subnet01-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff"
            },
            {
                "ip_address": "2001:db8::6",
                "subnet_id": "subnet02-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff"
            }
        ],
        ...
    },
    "priority": "INFO",
    "publisher_id": "network.hostname.domain_name",
    "timestamp": "2018-11-25 09:00:06.842727"
```

k2hr3_osnl assumes messages formatted by **messagingv2** driver as a default because they contain IPs and instance unique ids, which are important for k2hr3 to work properly. If your [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) services uses **messaging** driver, please refer the [Parsing versioned messages from OpenStack nova](https://k2hr3-osnl.readthedocs.io/en/hotx/usage.html#parsing-versioned-messages-from-openstack-nova) to change the configuration for  k2hr3_osnl.

If you don't know much about the [driver](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/configuration/neutron.html#oslo-messaging-notifications]) what your [OpenStack neutron](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/) uses, Please examine your /etc/neutron/neutron.conf or ask your [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) system administrators.

* [OpenStack Oslo.messaging](https://github.com/openstack/oslo.messaging) is an OpenStack library for messaging.  
* Python3. [OpenStack Oslo.messaging](https://github.com/openstack/oslo.messaging) is a Python module. We select Python3 because [OpenStack Technical Committee](https://governance.openstack.org/tc/) stated that All OpenStack projects must complete the work for Python 3 support by the end of the T cycle which I believe means the middle of 2019. Please see the [2018-05-29 Python2 Deprecation Timeline](https://governance.openstack.org/tc/resolutions/20180529-python2-deprecation-timeline.html) for details.
